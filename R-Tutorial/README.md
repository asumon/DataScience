# Learn-R-step-by-step
Hey guys! Welcome!

In this tutorial, you will learn R language from the very beginning. This is a tutorial about R language and programming so, I will cover some basic statistical concepts. For some advanced statistic knowledge, I will recommend some materials for learning. 

This tutorial is also my learning summary, so I maybe make some errors. If you find some mistakes, please tell me, my email is asumon@gmail.com. I will so appreciate it.

Most tutorials will be finished in the jupyter notebook. So, the form of code's results might be a little different with the way in the R console or the R studio. If you confused about it, try the codes by yourself. 

Again, I hope this tutorial could help you. 

Let's start! :metal:
