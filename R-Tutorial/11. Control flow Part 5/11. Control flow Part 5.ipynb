    "# Control flow Part 5\n",

    "\n",
    "We are almost there. Today, we will continue on control flow. So far, we already touched `for` loop,` while` loop, and `if-else`. This tutorial, we will talk about two little things, `break` and `next`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two statements I did not mention in loop because they need to use with `for` loop or `while` loop together. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Break**\n",
    "\n",
    "`break` means break. In a loop, if we do not set any conditions, then the loop will iterate each value in the sequence, but, how could we stop loop early if some conditions are met? The answer is `break`. Here is a logical plot to show how `break` works.\n",

    "```R\n",
    "# For loop with break\n",
    "for (item in sequence) {\n",
    "  if (condition) {\n",
    "    break\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  statement1\n",
    "  statement2\n",
    "  ...\n",

    "# While loop with break\n",
    "while (conditions) {\n",
    "  if(condition) {\n",
    "      break\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  count <- count + 1\n",
    "  statement1\n",
    "  statement2\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the logic is simple.  In one loop, when `if` statement is true then break the current program which means the loop be terminated.  If not the `if`  statement is false, then `if` statement will do nothing to the whole loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometime, in a loop, we would like to ignore some cases. In this case, `next` will help us.\n",

    "  statement2\n",

    "# while loop with next\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"r-next-flowchart.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the logic plot for the `next` statement.  In loop, when `if` statement is true, the loop will ignore this particular item, then move to next one. Here is different with break, the break will end loop but next will not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we did not give any example to show the details because next tutorial we will combine all control flow and show a lot of cases.\n",
    "\n",
