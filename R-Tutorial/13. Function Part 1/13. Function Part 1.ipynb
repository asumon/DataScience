    "Hey, guys, welcome back. Today, we will start a new chapter. The FUNCTION. R provides a lot of functions for us. We use the functions to do everything in R. So, you can tell it is impossible to introduce all functions here. In these new tutorials, we will focus on how to build our functions. Why do we need to do it, the answer is obvious, everyone has their own requirements, so we need our functions to meet the requirements.\n",

Do not do it immediately, try to Google first. Maybe some function has already been created. If you cannot find the suitable one, then write it on your own.\n",
